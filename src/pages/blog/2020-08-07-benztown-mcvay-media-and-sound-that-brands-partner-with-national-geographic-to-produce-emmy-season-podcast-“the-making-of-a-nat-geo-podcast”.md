  Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, in-person screenings – a staple promotional
  event during awards season – has become impossible. So National Geographic
  Networks’ Chris Albert, EVP of marketing strategy and global communications,
  and Stephanie Montgomery, Sr. Director of Communications and Awards, had an
  idea. “Stage” these events a new way, via their first-ever “For Your
  Consideration” podcast, The Making of: A Nat Geo Podcast. They turned to
  Benztown, McVay Media, and Sound That BRANDS to produce The Making of: A Nat
  Geo Podcast, a 12-episode “For Your Consideration” podcast series featuring
  interviews with Nat Geo Emmy contenders, in front of and behind the camera,
  and the very first podcast ever created in the “For Your Consideration”
  category.

Hosted by entertainment journalist Stacey Wilson Hunt, The Making of: A Nat Geo Podcast features interviews with on-screen talent and other Emmy contenders including Dr. Amani Ballour (“The Cave”), Jeff Goldblum (“The World According to Jeff Goldblum”), Dr. Jane Goodall (“Sea of Shadows”), Bear Grylls (“Running Wild with Bear Grylls”), Marcia Gay Harden (“Barkskins”), Keegan-Michael Key (“Brain Games”), Gordon Ramsay (“Gordon Ramsay: Uncharted”), David Thewlis (“Barkskins”), Neil deGrasse Tyson (“Cosmos: Possible Worlds”) and Sue Aikens (“Life Below Zero”).

Mike McVay, President/CEO, McVay Media, said: “The idea to utilize a 12-episode podcast series to inform and heighten the awareness of Emmy voters came from the creative minds of Nat Geo’s Stephanie Montgomery and Chris Albert. The troika of Benztown, McVay Media and Sound That BRANDS brought the series to life.”

Dave Beasing, CEO, Sound That BRANDS, said: “Great storytelling connects people and brands. These behind-the-scenes stories are compelling to both Television Academy voters and fans of these incredible programs.” 

Dave “Chachi” Denes, President, Benztown, said: “Social distancing necessitated this marketing innovation for showcasing exceptional programming during awards season. Now these types of podcasts that extend content producers’ stories and highlight the key players in those stories will be the standard for promoting shows ‘For Your Consideration’. We are thrilled to have been a part of helping Nat Geo develop the very first podcast in this category – one that hits all the right notes to engage and captivate the entertainment community with its diverse and compelling programming.”
