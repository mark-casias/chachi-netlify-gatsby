Benztown, the most powerful name in audio branding, announces that it has added three new production library affiliates in March, bringing its creative audio imaging workparts to over 1,200 affiliates worldwide. Benztown’s newest affiliates are: Beasley Broadcast Group’s WBOS-FM/Alt 92.9  in Boston, MA (Rock Library); Hubbard Broadcasting’s WTMX-FM/101.9fm THE MIX in Chicago, IL (Hot AC Library, VO, Custom Imaging); and Salem Media Group’s KFSH-FM/95.9 FM The Fish in Los Angeles, CA (AC Library).

Dave “Chachi” Denes, President, Benztown, said: “We welcome these three phenomenal audio brands to Benztown. We’re excited to be a part of helping to give them a competitive edge with libraries that enable their stations to stand out, stay fresh and break through with listeners.” Denes noted: “The best radio stations and audio brands sound different than their competitors, many of whom are using ‘big box’ imaging that perpetuates a sameness of sound that fails to differentiate them in the marketplace. Benztown libraries sound different because they are different. They are created by a diverse and talented team of audio production artists, composers, and musicians across the country and around the world who understand that being different is a good thing—and sounding different is an even better thing.”

Jimmy Steal, Vice President, Brand & Content, WTMX-FM/101.9fm THE MIX, said: "The package, the service, and the people are all top notch. An excellent product and experience working with them."

Ken West, Program Director, WBOS-FM/Alt 92.9, said: “Benztown provides the tools to make our stations sound alive with quick and excellent customer service. What’s not to love?”

With studios in Los Angeles, New York, and Stuttgart, Benztown offers the highest quality audio imaging workparts for 23 libraries across 13 music and spoken word formats including AC, Hot AC, CHR, Country, Urban, Rhythmic, Classic Hits, Rock, News/Talk, Sports, and JACK. Benztown’s proprietary web-based imaging solution, Benztown Branding, is used daily by nearly 1,200 broadcast radio stations and digital services worldwide.
